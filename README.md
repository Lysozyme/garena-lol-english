# garena-lol-english
This Python script changes the Leagues of Legends client language to English.
Unlike non-Garena regions, Garena users can't simply modify a config file to achieve this.
Since the procedure is a pain and also most info on Google is outdated due to a recent LoL update, here is a simple script for automation.

### Usage
1. Run the script (or executable) **AS ADMIN**
2. Run LoL via Garena as you normally would
3. LoL automatically closes and relaunches in English

Steps 1 and 2 can be in reverse order.

### Disclaimer
- Must run as admin since the Garena LoL client always runs as admin unlike other regions
- Only tested on Windows 10 & Taiwan server, but it should work for other Garena regions too
- Probably won't get you into trouble because the script does not run mid-game nor does it alter game files, but I can't take responsibility for bans etc.
